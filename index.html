<!-- 

Two possible ways to look at this... keep all sections independent of eachother and wrap in a div(s) and add padding/margins to make work. OR.. put the article inside of the section. Or...

Issues to correct:
.....................

ISSUE: overlap of margin on footer [fixed with margin-bottom on nav]
ISSUE: no separation of section and aside [fixed with margin-left on aside]
ISSUE: overall centering of sections on page... should all be centered? [fixed with "margin: 0 auto;""]
ISSUE: aside should be flush right... and fill size without making a bigger gap on left. does it need an absolute size or a percentage? or a remainder of some sort? Fixed, but still don't understand the control issue. Will investigate.
